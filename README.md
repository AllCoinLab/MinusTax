Writing here in private to claim that this concept is invented by me at this time.  
(check the commit history!)  
implementation can be dependent on situation.  
But I will write down in detail regarding limitation of the text  

# MinusTax

# Feature
Tax is Minus.

# Motivation
Why People should pay for the tax at Buy time?  
-> It degrades motivation for buying  
-> Paying tax. yeah ok. but it will be better if not pay.  
**-> It will be MORE BETTER if tax is MINUS**  

# How
Make sellers to pay more tax  
**-> It means sellers give their token to buyers**  
-> Enhances motivation for the buying  

# Implementation
## Sell Fee System
There are already fee system in the crypto world

## Buy Fee System
already in the crypto world.  
and it should be set to 0

## Minus Fee System at buy
There will be another contract A which holds the token  
token amount is determined by the minus fee and the liquidity pool.  
For example,
If liquidity pool has 100T token, (with certain amount of BNB)  
and minus fee is -10%,
contract A will have 10T token.  

### Proof of Theoretical Maximum amount
So in theory, someone can pay almost infinity amount of BNB.  
with the formula of constant K,  
that person will swap almost 100T token.  
Then person will get 10T token for extra.  
So theoretical maximum amount is 10T token.

### block buy/sell cycle abusing with sell fee
sell fee will be more than 10%.  
In the minimum sell fee of 10%,  
if someone buy 100 and actually get 110,  
and if sell it instantly will get 110 * 0.9 = 99  
which is less than 100 so person cannot abuse buy/sell cycle  

And for the safety margin + degrade sell motivation + other features, (ex. redistribution, etc)  
sell fee will be about 20%.

These days other tokens have buy/sell fee both with more than 10%.  
Regarding the incentive for the buy,    
20% sell fee seems reasonable. imo, more sell fee needed.  

# Opinion
I think it is,
Simple and Intuitive Project.
Easy to understand and can be acknowledged by people.

implementation difficulty: Low

Thank you
